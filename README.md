This is repository meant to understand and master C++ concepts, from basics to data structures in the language. As well as practicing for coding interviews & master advanced concepts.

## Preprocessor Directive

- The Preprocessor are the directives, which give instructions to the compiler to preprocess some code before actual compilation starts.
- The directive begins with '#'
- The actual code is compiled by the compiler only.

(#include) -> The directive tells the compiler to include the header file in the source code.
(#define) -> The directive tells the compiler to create symbolic constants. The symbolic constant is called a MACRO.
-> All subsequent occurrences of a MACRO in the source code will be replaced by its corresponding text before the program is compiled.


## Identifiers

- Both an identifier and a variable are the names allotted by users to a particular entity in a program.
- The identifier is only used to identify an entity uniquely in a program at the time of execution, whereas a variable is a name given to a memory location, that is used to hold a value.
